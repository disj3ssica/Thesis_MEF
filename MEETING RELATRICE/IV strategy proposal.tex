    \section{IV proposal}
    $Y$ can be:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item employment status (can only be done on a small portion of the dataset, pre-retirement: 50-66ish y.o.)
        \item social network quality and quantity 
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item in this case having a regressor pandemic=1 or similar is crucial to avoid conflating the effects of pandemic and MH worsening 
            \end{enumerate}
        \item health outcomes
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item decline in cognitive ability + memory tasks performance
                \item self-reliance in everyday activities
                \item physical activity 
                \item grip strenght (not sure what it could measure)
                \item needing external care (from family and professionals)
                \item prevalence/worsening of medical conditions (heart disease, dementia\dots)
            \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
Identification issues:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Reverse causality for all possible Y 
    \item Measurement error in MH (measured through questionnaires and self-reports)
    \item ???
\end{enumerate}
IV strategy:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Instruments often used in the literature:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item number of psychiatric disorders before 18
            \item religious attendance to handle problems (used in Chatterji et al 2007)
            \item number of parents psychiatric disorders 
            \item recent friends' death (not family to avoid correlation with model error)
        \end{enumerate}

    \item My other instruments proposals:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Number of days spent under strict lockdown measures (DATASET: Oxford COVID19 Government Response Tracker (n of deaths per 100000 and n of days with stringent control measures))
            \item Severity of childhood conditions (abuse, neglect - should check the detail of this info in SHARE)
            \item recent death in social network
        \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
Covariates in the model: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Individual characteristics (age, gender, educ, living conditions, income\dots)
    \item Country or region FE
    \item Others: \dots
\end{enumerate}
