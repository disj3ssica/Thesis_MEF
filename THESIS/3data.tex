% introduction
The overarching question guiding this study is: "How does mental health, as measured by various indicators, affect individual outcomes such as labor market participation, community activity, and social network strength?" To answer this question, we employ a dataset known as the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), which offers a rich array of variables pertinent to our study.
